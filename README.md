# luckydaymod
luckydaymod increases your daily luck -  for Stardew Valley
How to configure this mod :

open config.json and edit to your needs :

- enable - Set to TRUE if you want the mod to be enabled or FALSE to disable it
- debugmode - if you set this to TRUE you can use NUMPAD7 to set your daily luck to 0.999 double
and NUMPAD7 to print your current daily luck value to the SMAPI command window. 
You can also print it via executing the command "currentluck".
- luckvalue - the value that gets set inside the game on every second game frame update.
You can set it to any value you want but beware ! if you set it to higher than "0.115" you 
might crash the game somewhere because the games highest luck value to work with is 0.115 actually 
in patch 1.11 .
